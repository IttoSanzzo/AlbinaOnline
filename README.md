# Albina Online

**Albina Online** is the official web platform for the **Albina RPG** system, designed exclusively for our private circle, the Setsu TeaParty.

> A work-in-progress web-based personal project built by a single developer over three months, aimed at providing an interactive hub for managing characters and accessing system data.

## About

Albina Online is **not a generic tabletop platform**â€”it is specific to the Albina RPG system. It is a site where users can:

- Manage and store their characters
- Access and browse system catalog data
- Favorite and organize content
- Interact with other users in a controlled environment

> Note: The platform does **not include interactive tabletop mechanics** or usable game dice. It primarily serves as a web hub and user-oriented interface for the system, while also offering **interactive tools for system administrators** and **flexible character management features** for users, along with additional supportive functionalities.

## Access & Use

- Albina Online is primarily a **private project**, intended for Setsu TeaParty members.
- Interested users are welcome to explore the platform, but **must contact the developer directly** for access or inquiries.
- The platform **cannot be cloned and used independently** due to its dependency on our Albina API and related services.
